    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  
    <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My intention is to use this website as a reference for my professional information as well as ongoing hobbies and interests. As I work on new projects or research new interesting topics, expect to see new posts about it on this blog.</p>
  
    <p>Soon you should find a post / tutorial detailing how I made this website. It will likely be split into multiple parts to cover all of the details.</p>
  
    <p>Thanks for visiting! Stay tuned.</p>
