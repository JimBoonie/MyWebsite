  <p>If you have ever worked with data before or have performed any sort of scientific computing, chances are your workflow went something like this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Load some data into a new variable</li>
    <li>Pass variable to a function to process it</li>
    <li>Repeat Step 2. with other functions until desired results are achieved</li>
  </ol>

  <p>It's a very typical workflow, particularly for anyone coming from using MATLAB or any deep learning frameworks such as Torch or TensorFlow. Writing workflows like these in code is straightforward, but for tasks with shifting demands that require workflows to constantly change, it is neither efficient nor satisfying to keep piecing together sequences of functions in code alone.</p>

  <p>Defining such sequences of operations on data as a visual "operations graph" in a graphical user interface enables complex workflows to be designed rapidly, flexibly, and intuitively, providing the user with a sense of exactly what is happening to their data and where. It also demands that many details be implemented very thoroughly, and carefully. How will I make sure that this function will accept the <i>uint8</i> images coming from this other function? What if I need to pass the same variable to multiple functions and collect their outputs somehow? Most importantly, how can I make sure that I run these operations in an order that makes sure each function runs only once it receives the input it needs from all its preceding functions?</p>

  <p>This post is concerned primarily with solving the latter problem. I put together a solution to this problem as part of a larger project at my day job.</p>

  <h2>Definitions of Operations Graph</h2>

  <p>AWS should now be hard at work to generate your new instance. Go back to the EC2 Dashboard and click "Instances." You should see your new fella there, hopefully with an <b>Instance State</b> of "running." Click on your instance to view information about the little rascal. Under the "Description" tab, go ahead and copy the value under "IPv4 Public IP."</p>

  <h3>(Windows) Connect To Your Server</h3>

  <p>Windows, unlike Linux systems, doesn't support the use of OpenSSH from the command line. Instead, you will have to download and install <b><a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a></b>, an SSH client with a helpful GUI made for Windows users. This installer should also install <b>PuTTYgen</b>, which you will need to convert your private key <i>.pem</i> file (which PuTTY doesn't like) to a <i>.ppk</i> file (which PuTTY does like).</p>

  <p>Install PuTTY, then launch PuTTYgen. Click the "Load" button and find and select your <i>.pem</i> file. Next click "Save private key" to create your new <i>.ppk</i> file. If it asks you if you wish to save it without a passphrase, select "Yes."</p>

  <p>We would prefer, however, to have Apache serve the website that you just downloaded from my GitHub rather than serving its own default page. For that, we will need to edit the file <span class="code-inline">/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf</span>. Open this file using <span class="code-inline">nano</span> or your preferred text editor and add the following to the bottom, right above the <span class="code-inline">&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</span> line:</p>
