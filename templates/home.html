    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>I am the chief technology officer of CytoInformatics, LLC, a medical imaging informatics startup geared towards assisting pathologists and drug analysts to solve challenging image analysis tasks. Not too long ago, I obtained my Master of Science in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Florida. While pursuing my degree, I also volunteered, and was eventually employed, as a research assistant for the <a href="https://www.bme.ufl.edu/labs/yang/index.html">Biomedical Image Computing and Imaging Informatics (BICI2) Lab</a> under the instruction of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fskm0zEAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Lin Yang</a>. My research focus was on discovering features for myositis diagnosis in whole-slide images, which led to my thesis "<a href="http://uf.catalog.fcla.edu/permalink.jsp?20UF035292811">Selection of Salient Morphological and Network Features for Computational Diagnosis of Myositis</a>." In the meantime, I co-authored two papers: "<a href="{% static 'pdfs/mdnet2017.pdf' %}">MDNet: A Semantically and Visually Interpretable Medical Image Diagnosis Network</a>" and "<a href="{% static 'pdfs/miccai2015' %}">Robust Muscle Cell Quantification Using Structured Edge Detection and Hierarchical Segmentation</a>."</p>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy learning to use new skills and software development tools, such as TensorFlow, Django, Paper.js, and three.js. I also have experience using creative software like Autodesk Maya, FL Studio, and Adobe Photoshop. While pursuing my M.S. degree, I received 2nd place in the <a href="https://www.bme.ufl.edu/node/1724">2015 Biomedical Engineering Art of Research contest</a> and two honorable mentions in the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/elegance-science/art/2015-entries/">2015 Elegance of Science</a> contest for several images I created (sometimes inadvertently) during my research at BICI2 Lab. Traveling is a passion of mine and I have visited four continents (North America, South America, Africa, and Europe) and fully intend on visiting all seven, including Antarctica.</p>

          <h3>CytoInformatics.com</h3>
          <p>When I first became CTO of CytoInformatics, my first priority was to create <a href="https://cytoinformatics.com/">cytoinformatics.com</a>, a mobile-responsive website for the company. The site allows visitors to create an account, submit quotes for service, pay for services rendered, and even access a functional demo of our analysis portal. It is also SEO-optimized, allowing us to track user statistics and inform our marketing decisions.</p>
